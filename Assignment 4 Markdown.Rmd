```{r setup,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

#load in packages and data as csvs
library(vcdExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
lobster_traps <- read.csv("lobster_traps.csv")
lobster_size <- read.csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")

View(lobster_traps)

```

###Part 1A Creating summary data tables 

```{r}

#Coerce data into counts
lobster_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_size, freq="COUNT")

traps_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_traps, freq="TRAPS")


```


```{r}
#Make a summary data table for lobster abundance and fishing pressure

lobster_count <- lobster_expanded %>% 
  filter( SIZE != -99999) %>% #remove negative value
  count (YEAR, SITE) %>% #select relevant years
  spread(SITE, n)#find annual sum for 2012-2017
  
View (lobster_count) #view new data frame

lobster_table <- kable(lobster_count, col.names = c("Year", "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpinteria", "Isla Vista", "Mohawk", "Naples")) %>% #create summary table and rename columns
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) #styling

lobster_table

```



```{r}

trap_count <- traps_expanded %>% 
  count (YEAR, SITE) %>% #select relevant columns
  filter(SITE != "ABUR") %>%
  filter(SITE != "AHND to AQUE") %>% 
  filter(SITE != "AHND") %>%  
  filter(SITE != "GOLB") %>%  
  spread(SITE, n) #find annual sum for 2012-2017
  
View(trap_count)

trap_table <- kable(lobster_count, col.names = c("Year", "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpinteria", "Isla Vista", "Mohawk", "Naples")) %>% 
 kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) #styling

trap_table

```

####Part 1B Creating Summary Line Graphs (Attempting)

```{r}
# Make a line graph of annual lobster abundance at each site

lobster_line <- ggplot (lobster_count, aes( x = YEAR, color = Site)) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2012,2017)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs( y = "Number of Lobsters Counted Annually by Site")

lobster_line

```


```{r}
#Make a line graph of annual lobster fishing pressure at each site

trap_line <- ggplot (trap_count, aes(x = YEAR, color = Site )) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2012,2017)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs( y = "Number of Traps Counted Annually by Site")

trap_line

```


















## Number 2
Create data frame where each lobster has its own row, case format using vcdExtra
```{r}

lobster_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_size, freq="COUNT")



```

Exploratory Histogram 
```{r}
lobstersize_hist <- ggplot(lobster_expanded, aes(x=SIZE)) +
  geom_histogram()

lobstersize_hist

#large sample size, normally distributed
```

Exploratory qqplot

```{r}
lobstersize_qq <- ggplot(lobster_expanded, aes(sample=SIZE)) +
  geom_qq()

lobstersize_qq

#large sample size and normally distributed according to qqplot

```

Variance test (Levene's)
```{r}

levene.test
```
