```{r setup,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

#load in packages and data as csvs
library(vcdExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
lobster_traps <- read.csv("lobster_traps.csv")
lobster_size <- read.csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")

View(lobster_traps)

```

###Part 1A Creating summary data tables 

```{r}

#Coerce data into counts
lobster_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_size, freq="COUNT")

traps_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_traps, freq="TRAPS")


```


```{r}
#Make a summary data table for lobster abundance and fishing pressure

lobster_count <- lobster_expanded %>% 
  filter( SIZE != -99999) %>% #remove negative value
  count (YEAR, SITE) %>% #select relevant years
  spread(SITE, n)#find annual sum for 2012-2017
  
View (lobster_count) #view new data frame

lobster_table <- kable(lobster_count, col.names = c("Year", "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpinteria", "Isla Vista", "Mohawk", "Naples")) %>% #create summary table and rename columns
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) #styling

lobster_table

```



```{r}

trap_count <- traps_expanded %>% 
  count (YEAR, SITE) %>% #select relevant columns
  filter(SITE != "ABUR") %>%
  filter(SITE != "AHND to AQUE") %>% 
  filter(SITE != "AHND") %>%  
  filter(SITE != "GOLB") %>%  
  spread(SITE, n) #find annual sum for 2012-2017
  
View(trap_count)

trap_table <- kable(lobster_count, col.names = c("Year", "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpinteria", "Isla Vista", "Mohawk", "Naples")) %>% 
 kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) #styling

trap_table

```

####Part 1B Creating Summary Line Graphs (Attempting)

```{r}
# Make a line graph of annual lobster abundance at each site

lobster_line <- ggplot (lobster_count, aes( x = YEAR, color = Site)) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2012,2017)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs( y = "Number of Lobsters Counted Annually by Site")

lobster_line

```


```{r}
#Make a line graph of annual lobster fishing pressure at each site

trap_line <- ggplot (trap_count, aes(x = YEAR, color = Site )) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2012,2017)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs( y = "Number of Traps Counted Annually by Site")

trap_line

```


















## Number 2
Create data frame where each lobster has its own row, case format using vcdExtra
```{r}

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
library(vcdExtra)

>>>>>>> d50b55e6d1b4149c2714c0799ca4a10bb3700566
lobster_expanded <- expand.dft(lobster_size, freq="COUNT")

lobster_expanded2017 <- lobster_expanded %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2017) 


```

Exploratory Histogram 
```{r}
lobstersize_hist <- ggplot(lobster_expanded2017, aes(x=SIZE)) +
  geom_histogram()

lobstersize_hist

#large sample size, normally distributed
```

Exploratory qqplot

```{r}
lobstersize_qq <- ggplot(lobster_expanded2017, aes(sample=SIZE)) +
  geom_qq()

lobstersize_qq

#large sample size and normally distributed according to qqplot

```

Variance test (Levene's)
```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD

levene.test
=======
# install car package to compute levene's test
library(car)

# Levene's test with one independent variable
leveneTest(SIZE ~ SITE, data = lobster_expanded2017)

# low P value, according to the pvalue, variance is not equal, but its less than 4x. 

```

One way ANOVA - is there a difference between two or more means?
```{r}
lobstersize_aov <- aov(SIZE ~ SITE, data = lobster_expanded2017)
lobstersize_aov
```

Post-hoc Tukey's test
```{r}
tukey <- TukeyHSD(lobstersize_aov)

tukey
>>>>>>> d50b55e6d1b4149c2714c0799ca4a10bb3700566
```

Graph data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

lobster_size_2017 <- lobster_expanded2017 %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2017) %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(meansize = mean(SIZE),
            sd=round(sd(SIZE), digits = 2))

lobstersize2017_figure <-ggplot(lobster_size_2017, aes(x=SITE, y= meansize, fill = SITE)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "black", width = 0.5, stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Location", y = "Size (mm)", title = "Mean lobster size by location in 2017") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meansize-sd, ymax=meansize+sd), width=.1)+
  theme_classic()+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0,150))+
  theme(legend.position="none")
  




lobstersize2017_figure
```
